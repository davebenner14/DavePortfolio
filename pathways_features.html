      <p>
        The "Pathways to Employment" platform is crafted using a modern web
        technology stack to provide a robust solution for assisting individuals
        with disabilities in acquiring vital job and life skills. The
        application leverages React for dynamic front-end interactions and
        Express.js to handle back-end services efficiently, ensuring seamless
        user experiences.

        Each user profile on the platform is tailored to show personalized
        information, including registered classes and upcoming events. This is
        supported by React's state management, which dynamically updates
        user-specific content without reloading the page, enhancing the user
        experience.

        Calendar, allowing staff to manage class schedules interactively. The
        system includes functionalities for adding, editing, and removing
        events, which are instantly synchronized across user views thanks to the
        efficient state handling by React and real-time data updates from
        Express.js.
